# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

#### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

#### About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

#### Problem
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, The director of marketing believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

The director of marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. The director of marketing and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

#### Task
The director of marketing has assigned you to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

#### Dataset
Previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data

#### Data Analysis Process
The data consisted of 12 files containing more than 5 million records of ride histories from November 2020 to October 2021. Then, I combine all the data into one single big data frame and then I cleaned up the data and add some new columns for later analysis. Some of the cleaning process that I do was check and remove for duplicates, check and remove bad data. So, at the end I have 4,433,475 records and 19 fields.
